   5. 7+ PAD


 1. NSG routers.

 NX-300  -  it  is  intended  basically  for  access  in  corporate lans. Has 2
 universal wan port (sync/async) also supports many protocols, as Example:

 For asynchronous lines:

  ú Frame Relay
  ú X.25 (X.25 DTE/Switch DCE, RFC 1356, Reverse Charging, Fast Select, NUI);
  ú Cisco/HDLC.
 
 For synchronous:

  ú PPP (RFC-1661, RFC-1662);
  ú SLIP (RFC-1055);
  ú PAD (X.3/X.28/X.29).


 NSG-504  -  as a whole too most, but it was positioned for work with DSL. Also
 used  for  access in x25 and Frame Relay. Have the same set of protocols as in
 NS-300.

 Standard  prompt of NX-300 and NSG-5xx mostly "*" (like in usual pads), Though
 there is also something such as " nx300 > ".

 Such  pads  works is rather transparent: the data acting from the user will be
 transformed  in  x25  packets  according  to  adjustments  of  this  pad,  and
 transferred via x25. And vice-versa. Pads have standard x28 commands, but this
 also have some additional:

 - cut--

 *id
 NSG PAD Version 7.6.1 (Mar 1 2002) PORT *TN00

 ADn - a call of a auto substitutions line, where n number of a line
 (from 0 up to 7)

 MN - Manager (setup):

 *mn

 COM

 Password:
 To prevent illegal access to Manager change the password (see ' S W PW:? ')

 You have messages. Type command D E (Display Errors)

 nx-300:

 - cut--


 On default,the password to Manager empty.Some interesting info in adjustments:

 D A - display address table (' S A? ' for more);
 D R - display X25 routes and PVC (' S R? ' for more);
 D U - display NUI (' D U ' command shows passwords of PAD users);
 D W - display system parameters (' S W? ' for more);

 etc. 

 You  may  use such pads, as well as any others, for exception of that codes of
 mistakes are given slightly in the other kind:


 - cut--

 *25017720083334             

 COM

 CLR DTE C:0 D:0 - (here - Call cleared by remote device).

 2. Telematics ACP.
                                                                            
 ACP  (Access Communication Processor) - the switchboards used for accessing in
 x25   nets.  With  the  help  of  such  switchboards  many  x25  networks  was
 constructed, for example such as Rosnet (2506), ItalPac (2222) etc.


 Standard ACP prompt:


 - cut--
 ACP gateway 50; port: t051
 date: 2003-10-10 time: 3:53:09

 *
 - cut--

 
 Also setup callback is possible:

 - cut--
 Class of Service? techpub
 User name? john

 We wait when ACP will call us (about 1 minute)

 Password? 1234
 ACP gateway 1000; port: 13

 The system will go down at midnight.
 You are not allowed to make reverse charging calls today.

 *
 - cut--

 Needed mention, that on such ACP we may look at pad mnemonics list:

 - cut--
 *help mnemonics

 sym = " 50 * "sym"
 trace = " 50 * "trace"
 ACP10 = " 1010 * "sym"
 HOSTESS = "23421112234563"
 PSSCLOCK = "23421920100605"
 ACP550 = " 1055 * "sym"
 - cut--

 Here, for example, it is visible, where pad is located (England (2342)).
 "sym" - it is bindings to system manager:

 50 is the address and ` sym is the call user data. The asterisk delimits the
 address from the call user data.

 - cut- 
 *sym                                 

 ACP:fac: p (128,128), w (2,2), d (9600,9600)  
                                                                                                                                          
     com

 The configuration is original, but rather simple.Yet a lot of interesting 
 files on it, "show file" will help with it. Small list:

 acctoper - Accounting configuration.
 nodeconf - Global system (node) configuration.
 frvcconf - Frame relay PVC configuration.
 linkconf - Defines the behavior of the X.25 link (frame) level.
 linkstat - X.25 link (frame) statistics.
 x25stat - X.25 packet level status/statistics.
 x25call - X.25 interface call status.


 Example, working with files:

 - cut--

 BTACP50 sym > file netmap
 record initialized to default values
 BTACP50 sym > lnames
  
     file netmap contains the following records:
          1. 0* 2. 50* 3. *
          4. 50* 5. * 6. 123435099351*
          7. 999 8. 1010* 9. 23421113323410*
         10. 23421113323455* 11. 1055* 12. 888
         13. 7* 14. 555 15. 234
         16. 23421230223503 17. 2342911*

 BTACP50 sym > list 16

     file netmap contains the following records:
 record *16
 dynamic parameters
   0. netaddr = 23421230223503 1. userdata = *
   2. nodeid = 432

 3. Cisco routers.

 Ios has support of x25 nets. ITU-T recommendations implemented, that allow use
 this  routers for accessing PSN, and may give x25 services, what often used by
 banks, government and corporations.
 

 The router configuration in relation to x25 allows to do such things as:

 - choice encapsulation of X.25 packets in DTE or DCE mode; 
 - translation (IP, IPX etc.) addresses in X.121 addresses; 
 - the organization of permanent virtual connections (PVC) X.25; 
 - the organization incoming, outgoing or bi-directional switched 
   virtual connections (SVC) X.25; 
 - Adjustment parameters of X.25: lengths of incoming and outgoing packets, 
   windows sizes of reception and distribution of packets, a range of 
   numbering of packets on the third Level; 
 - organization of PADs ports according to recommendations X.3/X.28/X.29. 


 Cisco`s system u may found everywhere . For us interesting, exist or not route
 in x25:

 cisco-1 > sh x25 route
 %X.25 routing is not enabled 

 cisco-2 > sh x25 route
 Number X.121 CUD Forward To
   1 91822065 translation, 64 uses
   2 918220650 translation, 0 uses

 cisco-3 > sh x25 route
  * Match Substitute Route to
  1 dest 111 xot 10.10.10.1
 
 Here accordingly: 

 cisco-1 - has no relation to x25 except IOS has X.25 software.;)
 cisco-2 - connected to x25 network directly.
 cisco-3 - connected to x25 through another cisco XOT. 

 Well that's all, now it is work;):

 cisco-3 > pad 25017720083335
 Trying 25017720083335. Open

 Well or

 cisco-3 > x28

 *25017720083335

 COM

 etc...


 Also  cisco  pad  can  be  already bind on separate port. Prompt as well as at
 nx-300,  nsg-5xx:  "*".  Help format slightly different from another, it allow
 fast determine that it cisco pad.

 *help
 The "help" PAD command signal consists of the following elements:
  < help PAD command signal > < help subject >
   where
  < help subject > is the identifier for the type of
                 explanatory information requested

 5. X.25 over TCP (XOT)

 Now a bit about encapsulation. For tutorial info read "Cisco Systems X.25 over
 TCP (XOT)" (rfc1613). In brief, main idea that x25 packets transferred via tcp
 :)  For  that  purpose was reserved 1998 port. Protocol was developed directly
 cisco  and  JANET. In what his interest? Xot protocol implemented in all upper
 described  hardware  (NX-300, NSG-5xx, ACP, cisco). If you want it is possible
 to find xot with routines in different x25 networks and to make the gateway in
 x25. In other words, setup x25 route from one route, through xot of another.
 

                    telnet        xot
                 We--------> cisco1-----> cisco2 (xot)----> x25


 On  cisco1 we build up routines through cisco2`s xot port, which have route in
 x25.Well that's all :) For comfortable,it is possible bind x28 pad on separate
 port. All about it well described on cisco.com so trying ;).



 6. 7 + PAD

 Information about this pad it is not enough in internet. You may possible find
 it  on hardware by Hungarian 7 + Computer Network Ltd. I however get soft from
 this hardware (yet many interesting things),but connect to global x25 not have
 successful, may be only local network. Search and will find :)
