  In е25 networks,in depend of them specific, not so easy use sniffers,becouse,
 very  often we are not have access on x25 link himself, but connect to PSN via
 PAD. And  no  ways  to  install  something  on that :) However, its needed for
 debuging purposes, so, if u very luck, u may find NUA on which good admin stay
 for us  and  for  wide  public,  analogue of sniffer/monitor in x25 nets, Data
 scope. So, stop talking about nothing,lets look how its thing seen. i think 87
 port its standart for it.

 Data  Scope,  util  for  search faults, monitoring of е25 connections, work on
 VANGUARD  routers.  built  it  util in routers OS or connected in some another
 way, exactly not known :)

  In general,  As  should expect, our ask about port to monitor, network layer,
 EIA(rs232?)  seen as for diagnostic hardware problem, timestamp,  and i think,
 mode in that show results, hex/char \ byte.

 for others port numbers, our not asked about monitore EIA, but asked about how
 many  users  bytes  show :) so, after initiated monitor on 3 port, scanned all
 ports of this nua, monitro display nothing. On ports\incloming LCN channels on
 this host not present nothing interesting, except strange 1-2 ports and 98 ;)

 So,  we  are  not  give  up so easy,and start monitoring port 2, and trying to
 connect to 02 nua port from another pad.

 As seen,sufficiently   interesting  and  advanced  monitoring  system  in е25.
 However, we a not recv on display, data,what send after connect :) As however,
 and not find any kind of documentation about data scope,if somebody found/have
 - mail me. cya.
